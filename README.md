## Introduction

Welcome to Eat Stronger! We are a team of students from the University of Wisconsin - Madison, dedicated to helping you eat better, healthier, and stronger. In today's society, being overweight is a common issue in the United States. According to the National Institutes of Health, nearly 1 in 3 adults (30.7%) are overweight, and more than 2 in 5 adults (42.4%) have obesity. Obesity can lead to serious health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, musculoskeletal disorders, and certain cancers.

We aim to provide you with the data and tools necessary to develop healthy eating habits and maintain a balanced lifestyle.
