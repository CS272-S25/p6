    <h2>Why Eat Stronger?</h2>
    <p>In modern society, being overweight is a common thing in the United States. According to the information provided by the National Institutes of Health, 
        “According to 2017–2018 data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES): 
        Nearly 1 in 3 adults (30.7%) are overweight. More than 2 in 5 adults (42.4%) have obesity.”</p>
    <p>Obesity can lead to many physical illnesses. According to the World Health Organization, 
        “Being overweight or obese can have a serious impact on health. Carrying extra fat leads to serious health consequences such as 
        cardiovascular disease (mainly heart disease and stroke), type 2 diabetes, musculoskeletal disorders like osteoarthritis, and 
        some cancers (endometrial, breast and colon). These conditions cause premature death and substantial disability.”</p>
    <p>We hope that the data and tools provided by our website can help visitors develop a healthy eating habit in the future and keep obesity and disease away.</p>
