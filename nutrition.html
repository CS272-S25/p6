    <h2>Learn About Nutrition</h2>
    <p>What is Nutrition? What are nutrients? What is some of the Common Myths and Misconceptions about Nutrition?</p>
</section>

<section class="m-3">
    <h2>What is Nutrition?</h2>
    <p>According to Cleveland Clinic: "Nutrition is the process of eating and absorbing food that your body needs for nourishment. 
        It involves breaking down food into nutrients. Nutrients are chemical substances your body needs to function. But this essential process does much more than that."</p>
</section>

<section class="m-3">
    <h2>What are Nutrients?</h2>
    <p>According to Cleveland Clinic: "There are six major classes of nutrients. Eating well is a balancing act that combines all six. The nutrients in the food you eat benefit your body in different ways."</p>
    <p>"Macronutrients provide energy and keep your body working. Micronutrients are vitamins and minerals. They support your metabolism, 
        among other functions. Water rounds out the list of essential nutrients. It supports nutrition in many ways, like carrying nutrients and oxygen to your cells."</p>
    <h3>Macronutrients</h3>
    <p>"If your body was a building, macronutrients would be the foundation. Macronutrients are your main source of energy."</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Carbohydrates:</strong> "Like sugars, starches and fiber, which are the main source of energy powering your body."</li>
        <li><strong>Lipids:</strong> "Which are in fats, oils, meat, dairy and other foods — do many things like storing energy and digesting fat."</li>
        <li><strong>Proteins:</strong> "Which help to build and repair muscle, as well as regulate hormones"</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Micronutrients</h3>
    <p>"Micronutrients include essential vitamins and minerals. You need fewer micronutrients than macronutrients, but they’re still very important."</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Vitamin A:</strong> "Supports your immune system, metabolism and vision."</li>
        <li><strong>Vitamin C:</strong> "Supports your body in many ways. It helps your body grow tissue. It can also heal wounds and strengthen your immune system."</li>
        <li><strong>Vitamin D:</strong> "Partners with calcium to build and maintain healthy bones. Vitamin D also supports brain health and your immune system."</li>
        <li><strong>Iodine:</strong> "Promotes brain development, thyroid health and more."</li>
        <li><strong>Iron:</strong> "Helps your body make hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells."</li>
        <li><strong>Sodium:</strong> "Helps cells absorb nutrients. It helps muscle and nerve functions."</li>
        <li><strong>etc.</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common Myths and Misconceptions about Nutrition</h2>
    <h3><i>1. Skipping breakfast does no harm to your body.</i></h3>
    <p><Strong>WRONG!</Strong> According to National Libary of Medicine: "Previous studies have suggested a positive association between increased hydration and preservation of kidney function. In addition, 
        the limited evidence known about irreversible kidney damage from chronic underhydration and malnutrition also suggest a possible relationship between dietary patterns and CKD [12,13]. 
        Studies have shown that low meal frequency and skipping breakfast are associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), metabolic syndrome, and diabetes."</p>
    <h3><i>2. Low fat = Healthy? Full-fat products = weight gain?</i></h3>
    <p><Strong>WRONG!</Strong> According to Mayo Clinic Health System: "Many products labeled low-fat or fat-free contain added sugar or sodium to help make up for the loss of flavor when removing or reducing fat. 
        In addition, fat helps with satiety — making you feel fuller longer. Choosing a fat-free product to reduce calories can backfire as you may find yourself snacking soon after."</p>
    <p>"The fat-free and low-fat diet trend is a thing of the past — 80s and 90s to be exact. Yet, some individuals are still scared of fat. This shouldn't be the case as fat has beneficial 
        functions like protecting our organs, maintaining cell membranes, promoting growth and development, and absorbing essential vitamins."</p>
    <p>"Be aware that fats aren't created equal. Choose heart-healthy unsaturated fats, such as olive and canola oil, nuts, nut butters and avocados 
        over those that are high in saturated and trans fats, including fatty meats and high-fat dairy products."</p>
    <h3><i>3. Avoid carbs if you want to lose weight.</i></h3>
    <p><Strong>WRONG!</Strong> According to Mayo Clinic Health System: "The low-carb diet is a fad diet that has continued to make an appearance over the years. It gives carbohydrates — fruit and whole grains 
        included — a bad reputation. Individuals who followed this diet had success with weight loss. But anytime anyone eliminates highly processed carbohydrates foods, such as chips, cookies, white bread and potatoes smothered in butter and gravy, 
        they would be expected to have the same results. Any diet or eating program that eliminates an entire food group gets a red flag from me as you likely will miss out on vital nutrients."</p>
    <h3><i>4. A detox diet will clean toxins out of the body.</i></h3>
    <p><Strong>WRONG!</Strong> According to Mayo Clinic Health System: "There's little evidence that dietary cleanses do any of the things they promise. The fact is you don't need to purchase a product to 
        cleanse your body. Your liver, kidneys and gastrointestinal tract do a good job of detoxing it every day. If you're looking to rejuvenate your body, focus on eating more whole foods, 
        drinking water and removing highly processed foods from your diet."</p>
    <h3><i>5. Use unrefined sugars, such as honey, maple syrup or coconut sugar in place of white table sugar.</i></h3>
    <p><Strong>WRONG!</Strong> According to Mayo Clinic Health System: "Sugar is sugar, although unrefined sugar options may contain a small number of vitamins and minerals. The advantage is minimal as they are 
        still considered added sugar and contribute to the recommended daily limit on added sugar in the diet."</p>
